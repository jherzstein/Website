Hello, my name is Jordan, I'm a Computer Engineering student from Canada. My general interests fall into free and open source software, computer privacy, thinkpads, and more. This is my website, I sometimes write blogs when I'm not lazy about current things that I'm doing and some technical guides. Also yes, my website is minimal.

* What am I up to?
+ I'm a full time student. 
+ A guy kijiji.ca sold me a Thinkpad T430 for $100CAD. His loss for selling off such a golden device.
+ [[../images/hatedaylightsavings.png][I (STILL) HATE DAYLIGHT SAVINGS! I (STILL) HATE DAYLIGHT SAVINGS!]]
+ I like to swim and read books and manga in order to stay sane. 
+ I'm trying Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
+ I like hobbies that I'm bad at.
