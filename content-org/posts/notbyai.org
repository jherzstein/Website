A new link button has been added to this website. As of the time writing this you may notice a badge at the site footer that looks like this:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html

This badge is provided by [[https://notbyai.fyi][Not by AI]], an organization focused on promoting content originality. I decided to add this after seeing it on [[https://sumnerevans.com/][this guy's site]]. This should indicate to you that, most likely, the content written for this site is *not* AI generated slop made for search engine optimization and maximum eyeball retention... it's only *human* generated slop. On a side note, and perhaps it is my fault for contributing to this, it is a bit dystopian that we've gotten to the point that people find it necessary to distinguish that their content is original, either as a point of pride or because in a lot of cases non-ai generated material has become impossible to recognize in a vacuum. /sigh/.
