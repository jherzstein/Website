<p>Skiff was a privacy focused email service. I switched over to them a few weeks ago from Proton because I got it recommended to me from someone on campus for their very generous free tier that offered custom domain support. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to switch to my custom domain for unlimited aliases using it to organize my accounts, and I&rsquo;m admittantly cheap so I decided &ldquo;why not&rdquo; and gave Skiff a try. Honestly didn&rsquo;t care for their elliptic curve E2EE, zero access, quantum resistant hoo-ha, I just wanted free custom domains with incrementally better privacy than Google even though email sucks. I thought worst case senario I could always just switch back to Proton (my custom domain will keep me email-service agnostic), and Skiff&rsquo;s massive amount of capital investment would keep them afloat for at least a few years before I would make another switch. I literally just woke up to learn that they&rsquo;ve been bought out by Notion; indeed <a href="https://piped.video/watch?v=UWhKa7M52BA">I am a clown ðŸ¤¡</a>. This is sort of on me for being naive to trust this particular service that seemed &ldquo;a little too good to be true&rdquo; so take this from my experience, even though it should seem obvious: <strong>only trust an email (or any) service that has years of a track record to back it up.</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually somewhat grateful that this happened, because now I get to learn and this was a pretty low stakes mess up in the grand scheme of things. Even though I&rsquo;ve messed up, I&rsquo;m humbled, and despite my slight self-deprication I actually am not beating myself up too much over this. For one to avoid being a clown in the future, one must see the clown in their present selves, own up to it, laugh, honk their nose, and then finally remove the wig and makeup.</p>
