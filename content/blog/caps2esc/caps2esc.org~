#+TITLE: Mapping Caps Lock to Esc and CTRL in Xorg
#+DATE: <2022-10-18 Tue>
#+CATEGORY: Tutorial
I love Emacs, but it was designed in the 1980's in the era of old unix keyboards when the control key was next to the a button and had some undesireable consequences. While there are hobbyist keyboards for that kind of layout, no real usable laptop these days would oblige without some serious changes.

Sorry, I'm not interesting in having repetitive strain injury by the time I'm 40 because I used ~C-x C-f~ to search for files too many times.

One solution would be switching to . Many people use xmonad to change keyboard layouts but that's a bit too overkill for my tastes.

* The Guide

Main inspiration of this guide comes from Ben Davis on github who outlined a very similar guide but for making Capslock into an Esc and Mod4 key[[cite:mapping_caps_lock_esc_super_mod4_github]].

** Dependencies
This guide assumes you're using GNU/Linux or a BSD distrobution with Xorg as your display manager and are likely using a window manager of some kind. You will also need ~setxkbmap~ installed, though that should come with Xorg by default.

** Creating user defined layout in xkb
Create the file ~/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/custom_opts~ with the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC
// Make Caps escape when pressed once and 
xkb_symbols "ctrl_esc" {
    key <CAPS> { [ Escape ] };
    modifier_map Control { <CAPS>};
};
#+END_SRC

Edit ~/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev~ and add a new line in the ! option = symbols section:

#+BEGIN_SRC
custom:ctrl_esc = +custom_opts(ctrl_esc)
#+END_SRC

Edit ~/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst~ and add a new line the ! option section:

#+BEGIN_SRC
custom:ctrl_esc  Make Caps Lock an additional ESC and CTRL 
#+END_SRC

** Updating Keyboard layout
We can apply these changes from the command line using ~setxkbmap~. Using ~setxkbmap~ specifies the keyboard layout to be used based on the specified based on the components in ~/usr/share/X11/xkb/~ that we were just changing.  

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
setxkbmap -option "custom:ctrl_esc"
#+END_SRC

To run this automatically at the start of your xorg session, go into ~.xinitrc~ file and add the above command. Now when your Xorg session is restarted this keymapping will begin working.
