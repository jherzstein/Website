-   I have PGP as an option here but I really don't care if you don't.
-   [PGP isn't great](https://www.latacora.com/blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem/) and statistically speaking you're probably using gmail or some other providor that definitely reads your emails, in which case I'm not sure what difference it makes anyways. If you still want to go through the hassle you can learn how to use PGP [here](https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/).
-   Proton Mail users do not need to use PGP it is end to end encrypted by default amongst other Proton Mail users.
