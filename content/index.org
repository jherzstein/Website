Hello, my name is Jordan Herzstein, I'm a Computer Engineering student from Canada, a huge free software enthusiast, and I care about how technology effects human beings. This is my website, it's not ugly - it's minimal.

* What am I up to?
+ Studying full time.
+ Working with [[https://qset.ca][QSET]] as a member of the ECE rover design team.
+ Messing around with linux servers, I would like to eventually move this site to one of my VPS's when I have the time as I have greater ambitions for this site that full control over the webserver will provide me.
+ Playing with my roommate's cat.
+ "Revising" my resume.
+ Waiting for the winter break so I can start self hosting on my rockpro64. I would like to host my own [[https://xmpp.org][XMPP]] with [[https://jmp.chat][JMP]], and seed all my Linx ISOs full time.
