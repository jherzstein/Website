Hello, my name is Jordan Herzstein, I'm a Computer Engineering student from Canada, I like free and open source software. I consider myself a thinkpad and computer security hobbiest. This is my website, it's not ugly - it's [[https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/][minimal]].

Go ahead and sign my [[https://jordanherzstein.123guestbook.com][guestbook]]!

* What am I up to?
+ I'm a full time student. 
+ A guy kijiji.ca sold me a Thinkpad T430 for $100CAD. His loss for selling off such a golden device.
+ [[../static/images/hatedaylightsavings.png][I (STILL) HATE DAYLIGHT SAVINGS! I (STILL) HATE DAYLIGHT SAVINGS!]]
+ I like to swim and read books and manga in order to stay sane. 
+ I'm trying Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
+ I like hobbies that I'm bad at.
# + Setting up Webapps on my rockpro64, +I just set up [[https://git.jordanherzstein.xyz][cgit]]+ I either need to create a proper firewall so I feel comfortable publicly hosting stuff since default ISP routers suck or I'll use a VPS or something.
