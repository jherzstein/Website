Hello, my name is Jordan, I'm a Computer Engineering student from Canada. My general interests fall into free and open source software, computer privacy, thinkpads, and more. This is my website, I sometimes write blogs when I'm not lazy about current things that I'm doing and some technical guides. Also yes, my website is minimal.


## What am I up to? {#what-am-i-up-to}

-   I'm a full time student.
-   A guy kijiji.ca sold me a Thinkpad T430 for $100CAD. His loss for selling off such a golden device.
-   [I (STILL) HATE DAYLIGHT SAVINGS! I (STILL) HATE DAYLIGHT SAVINGS!](../images/hatedaylightsavings.png)
-   I like to swim and read books and manga in order to stay sane.
-   I'm trying Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
-   I like hobbies that I'm bad at.
