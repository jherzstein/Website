Currently my site theming is mainly based off of One Half dark theme / nord theme aesthetic, but the new light theme is going for a bit more solarized / light gruv-box vibe because I think a light nord theme looks a bit dilapidated. Get in touch with me and let me know how it looks. Couldn't find a way to get it done without at least a bit of javascript, so I adapted some from [kernal.eu](https://kernal.eu). I suppose I was also misinformed that neocities allowed no javascript in my [last update](/posts/thingstocome/) for some reason so neocities will stay.

In the theme of light, dark, and time; daylight savings needs to be abolished. at one point in the year I loose a whole hour of sunlight in my day, and another an hour of sleep. On a societal level, it messes with our circadian rhythms for no good reason in the modern era, higher levels of unipolar depression in the population, and results in unnecessary car fatalities (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Chesak 2024</a>; <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Ries 2020</a>). I would like to perhaps make an extended rant about it someday but this is already too long for a simple update. Not sure how to end this, so, have a nice day and remember to drink water, touch grass, and talk to another person.
