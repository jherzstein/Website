A new link button has been added to this website. As of the time writing this you may notice a badge at the site footer that looks like this:

<figure>
    <center>
       <img class="link-buttons" id="light-icon" src="/images/link-buttons/Written-By-Human-Not-By-AI-Badge-white.png" height="31" />
       <img class="link-buttons" id="dark-icon" src="/images/link-buttons/Written-By-Human-Not-By-AI-Badge-black.png" height="31" />

This badge is provided by [Not by AI](https://notbyai.fyi), an organization focused on promoting content originality. I decided to add this after seeing it on [this guy's site](https://sumnerevans.com/). This should indicate to you that, most likely, the content written for this site is **not** AI generated slop made for search engine optimization and maximum eyeball retention... it's only **human** generated slop. On a side note, and perhaps it is my fault for contributing to this, it is a bit dystopian that we've gotten to the point that people find it necessary to distinguish that their content is original, either as a point of pride or because in a lot of cases non-ai generated material has become impossible to recognize in a vacuum. _sigh_.
