I created the website [yortnet.com](https://yortnet.com) on the same oracle vps which I set up my free minecraft server through docker to also host various services and privacy front ends. I personally always use open source privacy front ends for accessing various internet resources, and I figured I might as well put some of my skills to use to provide some value as it would only cost me around $10 a year to renew the domain. Right now I just have a [searx](https://searx.yortnet.com) instance (a metasearch engine) running on the server though I plan on adding more services in the future when I have the free time. Everything runs behind an NGINX reverse proxy in which I have partially anonymized the logs which do not leave the server; see the privacy policy for more details. I hope you enjoy.
